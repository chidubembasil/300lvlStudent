Build a program that:

Welcomes the user with an alert.

Asks for the user’s name with a prompt.

Shows a menu of products using switch (e.g., 1 = Apple 🍎, 2 = Banana 🍌, 3 = Orange 🍊).

Uses prompt to let the user pick a product.

Asks for the quantity.

Uses operators to calculate the total price.

Shows the total with alert.

Asks with confirm if they want to checkout.

If yes, say “Thank you, [name], your order is confirmed!”

If no, say “Order canceled.”

Use if/else for decisions (valid choice, checkout confirmation).

Output the result in console.log and document.write too.

Task:

Start with a welcome alert → "Welcome to Simple ATM".

Ask for the user’s PIN (use a variable correctPin = 1234).

If pin is wrong → show "Access Denied" and stop program.

If pin is correct → continue.

Set a starting balance (e.g., balance = 1000).

Use a switch to show ATM menu:

1 = Check Balance

2 = Deposit Money

3 = Withdraw Money

4 = Exit

Based on choice:

If Check Balance → show balance.

If Deposit → ask how much, add to balance.

If Withdraw → ask how much, subtract from balance (but first check if enough money).

If Exit → show "Thank you for banking with us!".

Use a confirm at the end → “Do you want another transaction?”

If yes → repeat menu.

If no → show "Goodbye!".

🎯 Task:

Build a program that:

Greets the student with an alert.

Asks for student name with a prompt.

Uses an array to store subjects (e.g., ["Math", "English", "Science"]).

Loops through the array and uses prompt to ask for each score.

Stores scores in another array (e.g., [80, 90, 70]).

Uses operators to calculate:

total score

average score

Uses if/else to decide grade:

≥ 70 = A

≥ 60 = B

≥ 50 = C

≥ 40 = D

< 40 = F

Uses a switch to let the student choose grading system:

1 = Standard (A–F as above)

2 = Pass/Fail (≥ 50 = Pass, else Fail)

Uses confirm to ask if student wants to see results.

If yes → show results in alert, console.log, and document.write

If no → say “Results hidden.”
